# aws-dynamodb

## TODO (personal):
- Organize project structure for personal github


## Assumptions/changes/notes for TA
- headers that were originally 'Country' were changed to 'Country Name' for convinience
- shortlist_curpop had a column called "Population 1970" which I changed to "1970" to match the following column pattern
- automatic bulk load is done when creating all tables from csv files
- explain project structure
- add_records.txt needs to contain case sensitive keys (to match the column headers)
